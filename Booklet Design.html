							<h1>Booklet Design</h1>

							<h2>Stanford GEP Booklet</h2>
							<p>Designing this booklet was a fun challenge because it was an opportunity to display lots of data in a reader-friendly way. The Stanford Global Engineering Program (GEP) was looking to put its information into booklet form for the first time. The audience of the booklet ranged from potential investors to students looking for more information, so the final product had to be easily accessible and relevant to anyone picking it up for the first time.</p>

							<p>One of my goals was to include lots of quotes from students throughout the pages. To potential investors this would show how much students gain from their experiences abroad and to students thinking about applying to the program it would help tell a story. I also included the full map spread on pages six and seven to visually emphasize the incredible reach of the GEP. </p>
							
							<p>Looking back, this was a great project to start learning about how to layout data and it gave me the chance to work with new tools like Tableau and Sketch. As I learn more about design and visual fundamentals there are things I would change, but it’s a great starting point for the progression of my work.</p>

							<h2>"Listen" Booklet</h2>

							<p>During my internship at OTIS Elevator, I took time to learn about the innovation lab, another UTC department housed in the same building. The innovation team often helped other UTC entities understand how to use design thinking and human-centered design in their projects. One of the team members, Yrinee, asked if I would help create a booklet the team had been meaning to make for a long time about how to interview users effectively.</p>

							<p>The booklet was called “Listen” and the project morphed into a wonderful design exercise. As I found material and designed graphics for each page, I learned new things and tried to make each nugget engaging.</p>
